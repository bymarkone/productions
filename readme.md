## Workshop "Planning your professional growth"

  > This is a workshop that has the purporse of laying down an initial career plan for each attendant. It combines two different spheres of decisions - the long and the short term. The first one is the field of uncertainties, aspirations and dreams, and, despite the long time, it demands some decisions to be taken now. The second one is comprehend plans, actions and achievements, and it is composed of small units that will make future dreams possible. Since life, much more than software development, is dynamic and unstable, any plan should include space to adaptation and exceptions.

## Do legado monolítico à entrega contínua com microservices, REST e Java funcional

  > Nessa palestra contamos a experiência em evoluir um sistema de um grande cliente dos EUA da área de healthcare, que processa milhões de registros de produtos hospitalares. Partindo de um legado com base de dados caótica e códigos incompreensíveis, nossa responsabilidade foi aumentar a capacidade do sistema e ao mesmo tempo transformar sua arquitetura monolítica numa arquitetura com microservices – usando Domain-Driven Design, APIs REST, Java funcional e técnicas de Continuous Delivery.
  Contamos essa experiência destacando os passos para refatorar uma arquitetura tradicional para Domain-Driven Design, os benefícios do DDD, e como se pode, com pequenos passos, organizar o código na direção de microservices. Mostramos os benefícios que microservices trouxeram nesse projeto e como ajudam a baixar custos. E investigamos benefícios para implementar um design funcional, incluindo prevenção de bugs, redução de inconsistências de estados e aumento de legibilidade de código.
  Ao assistir essa palestra você irá enxergar como é possível migrar de um cenário caótico para um mais seguro e evolutivo – e também se inspirar em nossa experiência para aplicar mudanças nos seus sistemas legados.
