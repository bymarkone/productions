# Coaching

## Coaching, Influencing and Leadership

This multidisciplinary age is demanding that we develop different aspects in our professional life. Rarely is enough to do only one thing well. From several researchs on people motivation like that one did by Maslow, to studies on organizational design in the complexity age, all insist that human beings should be saw and developed in several angles.

At ThoughtWorks, other than the things closer to our specific roles (DEVs, QAs, marketing, recruiting, BAs etc.), we are all, in a way or another, consultants. Whatever the roles you play, there is always someone to influence and support.

In this talk we are going to talk about key points on three competences related with consulting (and, truthly, with many other areas that is related to people): 
  1. Coaching; 
  2. Influencing; 
  3. Leadership;
  
# Career

## Building Your Professional Journey

This is a workshop that has the purporse of laying down an initial career plan for each attendant. It combines two different spheres of decisions - the long and the short term. The first one is the field of uncertainties, aspirations and dreams, and, despite the long time, it demands some decisions to be taken now. The second one is comprehend plans, actions and achievements, and it is composed of small units that will make future dreams possible. Since life, much more than software development, is dynamic and unstable, any plan should include space to adaptation and exceptions.

# Technical

## From monolitic legacy to continuous delivery with microservices, REST and functional Java.

Is this talk we share the experience in evolving the system of a big US client of the healthcare market, that processes milions of records of medical products. Starting with a legacy system with caotic database and imcomprehensible code, our responsibility was the raise the system capacity, both in terms of users and functionalities, and at the same time transform its monolitic architecture to one with microservices - using Domain-Driven Design, REST APIs, functional Java and techniques of Continuous Delivery.

We will tell our experience highlighting the steps we did to refactor a tradition architecture to Domain-Driven Desing, the benefits of DDD, and how, with little steps, organize the code in the direction of microservices. We will show the benefits Microservices brought to this project and how it helped to lower the costs. We alse will investifate the benefits in implementing a functional design, including preventing bugs, reducing state inconsistencias are raising code readability.

In watching this talk you will be able to see how is possível to turn an coatic scenario to one more change-safe and evolutive - and also be inspired by our experience to apply changes like these also in our legacy systems.

## Javascript and Continuous Delivery

While practices like Design Thinking, Lean and Agile are expanding, we developers have been challenged to keep up with the promises made by this practices. Short time to market, adaptability to change, feature selection... all are needs with direct impact in our day to day practices.

At the same time, in the Javascript world, we are seing an explosion of tools and techniques offering support to automate, and speed up software processes. In addition to that, Javascript has become a first-class language in Continuous Integration Applications, allowing front-end codebases to grow and split among different teams.

In this tutorial we are going to use a base application to show the use of several JavaScript technologies in the context of Continuous Delivery. Some tópics included in this tutorial are:
  - Approaching business and software development: why do developers have to care about automation, testing, quality, integragion and continuous delivery?
  - The possibilities of the JavaScript world: when NodeJS revolutionized what is possible to be done with JavaScript.
  - Build automation with Javascript: grunt, gulp, npm and more.
  - Managing dependencies: Bower, NPM etc.
  - Testing JavaScript applications: Karma, Jasmine, Mocha, Chai, Sinon etc.
  - Libraries to build applications: Angular, Backbone and React.
  - Other JS utilities: lodash, q.js, polymer etc.

## Starting With Angular JS

A course that mixes theory and hands-on on the basics of developing angular applications (http://www.targettrust.com.br/busca?s=angular)

## What If Your Application Could Speak

Imagine a team developing for an specific business domain. We use languages to communicate with client, company and team. We also use programming languages to develop the system. And still, we aim that our code express, not only the correct syntax of the language, but knowledge that is proper to the business domain we are dealing with. And if it was possible to capture the meaning of the business and transform it in a language? We are going to talk about DSLs, its architecture and business use, and also how to implement and test them.
